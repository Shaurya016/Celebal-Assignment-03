I have created this on Google Colab and have shared the downloaded .pynb file here.
 >Loaded the Dataset:
   Imported the Iris dataset from an online source or uploaded it manually into the environment.
 >Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Visualized data to understand feature distributions and species relationships using:
   Pairplots to see feature relationships colored by species.
   Boxplots to examine the spread and differences of each feature across species.
   Correlation heatmap to identify how features relate to each other.
 >Additional Visualizations:
   Created bar graphs and pie charts to analyze the distribution and count of different Iris species.
